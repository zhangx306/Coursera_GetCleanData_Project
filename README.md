# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project
This directory is created for the final project for Coursera Data Science: Getting and Cleaning Data course.
It contains four files:

1. run_analysis.R, which does the following:

* download the zip file for data, unzip it and read. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. data_tidy.txt, which shows the tidy data set created by run_analysis.R

3. README.md (the file you are looking at), which explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

4. CodeBook.md, which provides info on all the variables and summaries calculated
